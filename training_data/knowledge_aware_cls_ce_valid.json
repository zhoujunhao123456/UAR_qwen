This was on of those rare books IMO anyway, that grabs your attention from the first sentence and keeps you riveted to the final word.I'm a fan of history and the middle ages and the characters that Mr Patterson and Mr Gross introduce you to in this book are so completely likable, other than the bad guys who you will truly dislike and want to see get their come ppance, you can pick your friends and enemies of today that these characters remind you of.I enjoy stories that are told as fiction but that have much truth interspersed throughout. I could really feel myself as Hugh back in the 11th century.I have been a mild fan of Mr Patterson's previously but The Jester sets him apart as a wonderful story teller that I'll now look much more favorably on.\nAnswer:",

She rests in a hospital room. Megan stays with her constantly and sleeps on the couch in her hospital room. The two girls talk and laugh and keep each other company. Show the kinds of things they talk about. Occasionally, researchers come in to examine Lily's progress including her mother. This involves exposing her privates and looking at them to see how she's healing. This is embarrassing for Lily, but Megan comforts her during these examinations. During one examination, Megan asks Lily if it's okay if she looks at it. Lily says yes. Lily sees the stunned look on Megan's face as she sees what Lily has between her legs. This worries Lily but Megan reassures her that her new girly parts are \"gorgeous\". This makes Lily feel very comforted. The fact that she felt comforted makes Lily realize she's starting to accept her new gender. This thought makes her head spin, but she decides it's for the best. Finally, three days after her surgery, Lily's bandages are fully removed and she is able to see her new parts for the very first time. She is stunned at the beauty of what she sees. For the first time, she realizes she really is just another girl just like her best friend Megan. She cries tears of joy and hugs Megan, united by their new shared femininity. Some of the doctors and nurses present to witness this, especially the female ones, are touched by the sight of Lily realizing her femininity for the first time and they cry along with her. She is relieved that she is finally allowed to pee (she had to hold it for three days while she healed, as per the ancient text her mother found) now that the bandages are removed, which she plans to do as soon as she finishes writing this entry. She is nervous about having to use the bathroom as a girl, but knows that Megan will help her feel comfortable. She comments on how full her bladder feels and how she can't wait to finally let it all flow out. Lily ends the diary entry on a slightly more hopeful note than before, but still with a note of uncertainty. She still isn't sure if she wants to be a girl, but she's more hopeful than ever before.",

Review: I think after 77 glowing reviews I would have little to add... but I do agree with everyone- it's an awesome DVD box set, especially if you liked any Animaniacs! This season includes the classics like Yakko's World country recital and Wakko's song about all the state capitols... BUY IT!! BUY IT!! You will LOVE IT!! Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nPositive\n\nTitle: Basic Entry - not very feature rich Review: For the price I thought I'd get more than what amounts to a basic spread-sheet program that sync's with Quicken.Yes, when I'm spending cash, or using a CC at the store, it's great that I can enter it into the PPC and it will import it into my Quicken. But it's not stand-alone. It won't really track your portfolios. And it does not display any charts or graphs.For $10 it's worth it, for $30 I would have rather saved the money and just entered in my reciepts when I get home.I would suggest looking at alternatives like MS Money and SPB Finance.

My child no longer has such a fussy time sputtering, gagging, gassing on leaky Avent bottles.I disagree with the people saying they are hard to clean. Actually, they require effort to clean them! Putting bottles in heat above 140 degrees or a dishwasher releases the chemical in the plastic called Bisphenol A.

That is what Angels Fall First sounds like. I was very disappointed with this first album, especially considering how incredible their other albums were. The two best songs (meaning four out of five stars) were Elvenpath and Know Why the Nightingale Sings, followed by This Moment Is Eternity and Beauty and the Beast. The rest were frankly hard to listen to. Look to Oceanborn and Once for Nightwish's best performances, because you won't find them here. Answer:\nChoose your answer from:\n (1). No;\n (2).

There's no decision yet on the timing of Tillerson's departure, which has been expected for months. But multiple sources close to the White House and across government said Pompeo is the leading candidate to take over at the State Department. President Donald Trump offered, \"He's here, Rex is here,\" when asked if he wants Tillerson to stay on the job by reporters at the White House Thursday after the news broke of the potential exit plan.The vacancy at the CIA would likely be filled, according to the tentative plan, by Sen.

Your question should be answerable based on the passage and only have one correct answer. Show the gap in your question with a _ .\n\nLet me give you an example: For four years we have waited expectantly for the pitter patter of tiny paws. Soon, that wait could finally be over. Tian Tian, the UK's only female giant panda, has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as August. However Edinburgh Zoo, where the pandas live, have warned people 'not to get too excited' as the process is 'extremely complex'. Moreover, on the two previous occasions keepers inseminated Tian Tian - whose name means 'Sweetie' - she has failed to produce a panda cub. She was artificially inseminated again in March this year, but keepers at the zoo say implantation - when a fertilised egg attaches to the uterus - has not yet occurred.Tian Tian has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as August. She has been inseminated twice before but so far failed to produce a cubTian Tian and Yang Guang arrived in 2011 from China to great fanfareOn loan at \u00a3600k a year, became first giant pandas to live in UK for 17 years\nThe answer to this example can be: Under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to _ at the age of two, the age at which they would normally leave their mother in the wild.\nHere is why: This is a good example. Based on the passage you can answer this question.\n\nOK. solve this:\nA transgender man is hoping to raise \u00a35,000 via crowdfunding to pay for an operation to remove his 34DD breasts. Kasey Hildreth, 21, from Hemel Hempstead, Herts, was previously known as Chloe and only came out as transgender in April this year. Despite sporting closely cropped hair and wearing masculine clothes, the 21-year-old says his body still feels 'completely wrong' because of his ample chest. However, the NHS has a waiting time of 13 months just for an initial consultation. He now wears a breast binder every day and is forced to cover up in oversized T-shirts with baggy hoodies in an attempt to conceal his chest.Kasey Hildreth, from Hemel Hempstead, is hoping to raise \u00a35,000The 21-year-old came out as transgender in April this yearHad previously thought he was a lesbian but now wants to transitionSays: 'I hate my body and I can't cope with having a female chest'\nAnswer:",

The city there has a library, a few temples to Auril, Helm, Oghma, Savras, and Talos and is a place where the dragon hasn\u2019t visited yet. As the adventurers arrive, they can choose to go to the temples to pray for guidance, if any of the party worship the gods, or try the library for information. Approaching the library, the eagle-eyed among them will spot from a distance a group of five (or a number mirroring the party) with red scarves leaving the premises. \nAs the party enters the library for information, they are stopped by Kasryn Wemplefemple, an old, rotund gnome. She asks the party if there is anything of interest they are looking for. As they mention the dragon, she seems a little nervous. She says that unfortunately they don\u2019t have information of that manner here, and to try elsewhere. If pressed and/or intimidated further, she will spill that she has been asked and threatened to not share any information about this topic with anyone that arrives and to turn them away by people with red scarves. After giving this information, she will tell the party about where to find information on the dragon. Alternatively, if the party leave empty-handed, they will be approached by another group of adventurers led by Luck of the Draw, a ginger Tabaxi who had a similar story from the town they visited. They will sell the party the information on the dragon that they know for a good sum, as they no longer want to be involved in the hunt.\nThe party learns that from the size and description, it seems to be a young Moonstone Dragon. These care little for material creatures, including humans, but are by no means evil. They can be impetuous and playful when young, maturing to be gentle and curious. They can breathe a cloud of light that knocks out creatures and dispels magic, leaving the affected creatures with amnesia of the events. They can be injured by elemental attacks and bright light and can traverse to the ethereal plane at will, which explains the difficulty in finding it. They often make their lairs in hidden woodland caverns or faerie mounds. It is said their tears are drops of mithril. \nWith this information, the party can report back to the Colonel for advice for where to go, commune with one of the gods, return to the library for more advice, ask in the city, or check their knowledge of the area to understand where might match this description. From this, they will determine to travel to Shea\u2019s Grove, a fey-touched thicket in Snapfoot Forest, a large woodland one day\u2019s ride to the north-west.",

You do not even have the pleasure of listening to her music in the background, assumedly because it is unauthorized. Selena was a great entertainer and an even better person.

Movie title: The Brood Movie plot: At the Somafree Institute, Dr. Hal Raglan humiliates his patient Mike by saying: \"you're just a weak person. You must have got that from your mother. It probably would have been better for you if you had been born a girl!\" On the dimly lit stage, Raglan demands a demonstration of anger, and Mike reveals angry red blotches covering his torso. The audience gasps. Raglan announces that this is psychoplasmcis; the physical manifestation of mental rage by the appearance of the welts on one's body.Meanwhile, Frank Carveth collects his nine-year-old daughter Candy from a 'Private Guest Room'. Candy wears a red coat with fur trim and hood. Bathing her, Frank finds bruises and scratches on her back. He drives to the Somafree Institute to confront Raglan and demands to see his wife Nola, whom has been committed there. Raglan refuses. Frank accuses Nola of abusing their daughter and says he will stop Candy's next visit. Raglan threatens legal action if Frank withholds a vital part of Nola's treatment. Frank then goes to his lawyer, Al Resnikoff, who tells him that Nola has a stronger legal position despite the fact that she is committed to a mental hospital. Frank says that he will do what he has to. He takes Candy to her maternal grandmother, Juliana, who seems highly strung out.Back at the institute, Raglan goes into Nola's room (play-acting as Candy) and he asks her why she hurt her daughter Candice. Raglan/Candice says: \"Mummies don't hurt their own children\". Nola sobs that they do. She tells Raglan that her own mother was \"fucked up and bad\". Raglan encourages her anger by telling her: \"Go all the way through it, right to the end.\"That evening at Juliana's house, she investigates a noise in the kitchen. Food, juice, glasses and dishes are thrown all over the floor. She is bludgeoned by what appears to be a small child wearing a red hooded raincoat with fur trim. As Candy watches from behind a door, small claw-like hands leaves bloodstains on the banisters. The next morning at his workplace, Frank is informed of...\nAnswer:",

Review title: Great Book Exhibiting Skepticism as a Science Product review: This book is a collection of essays and articles from the publications of CSICOP. (Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims Of the Paranormal.)I think this is a fine book for people who are interested in the relationship between science and skepticism, and it exhibits the kind of critical thinking that needs to be handed out in the educations of all people.I've widely read in this area and I found some parts of PARANORMAL BORDERLANDS OF SCIENCE out of date.(Published 25 years ago.)It discusses topics like Velikovskiism and spoon bending that I think have disappeared from wide public fanaticism. It is a relief to know that these ideas have faded away.\nAnswer:",

    "question": "Q: negative\n\nA: Huge disappointment - after reading all the great reviews on Yelp, I decided to have my family's Christmas dinner at Mon Ami Gabi.  Perhaps it was Christmas and the chef wasn't around or there was no delivery of fresh steak on Christmas day or whatever, but the steaks were the worst we've ever had at a restaurant that claimed to be a steakhouse of any sort.          We had the following:   - French onion soup - standard, decent, not spectacular - Frisee & bacon salad - tasty - Steak au poivre - Steak roquefort - Filet mignon with merlot butter  and red wine reduction  I think the problem is with quality of the steaks, the sauces were fine, but my mom's steak roquefort had the texture of cotton, my sister's steak au poivre had the texture of cotton with lots of veins and fat lumps, my filet mignon had a stringy texture like a inferior cut of meat and was not at all firm.  It was so bad that we left much of the entree untouched and left right after the main course, we didn't even have dessert on Christmas!!  This was a very disappointing meal and ruined our Christmas.    On the other hand, the service was fine and the  prices were definitely cheaper than traditional steakhouses, $31 for the filet and $23 for the regular steaks, but the quality is not anywhere near Ruth Chris, Morton or Fleming's.\n\nQ: positive\n\nA: Tucked away in the Old Port, L'Asssomoir is a delicious restaurant with a great ambiance and lively environment. The crowd is young, loud and fun - there was a DJ playing live music - and the food is excellent. We went to dinner late, maybe around 9:30, and the place was still packed with a large dinner and drinks crowd.  The menu is quite eclectic ranging from Spanish tapas, Latin American appetizers and tapas and wide array of tartares.   We ordered the plantain chips which we awesome - although I doubt that they were homemade. It brought us back to our 5-week trip to Costa Rica. My boyfriend ordered the Duck Confit Quesadillas and I got the Green Apple & Salmon Tartare. He enjoyed his - wasn't blown away, but it was good. Mine on the other hand was amazing. The salmon was fresh and bright and totally delicious. I would go back here in a heart beat.  http://queenofquinoa.blogspot.com @alyssarimmer\n\nQ: negative\n\nA: I called them for a simple repair to my pool pump on a Tuesday. They indicated that they might be able to get to it late in the week. They took all my credit card information and said they would call. They never did.

Some people buy as many as two or three different papers. Why do people read newspapers? Newspapers supply us with news about events in our hometowns, in our country, and in other parts of the world. Today we can read about important things that took place in foreign countries on the same day they happened, even in countries far away. But hundreds of years ago, news of things took months or even years to travel from one country to another. In those times, news was often passed from one person to another and never completely true. Newspapers today supply us with more than just what happened in our country or in other countries. If we want to know what the weather will be like, we can read the weather reports. If we want to find out what films are being shown, or what plays or concerts we can go to we can look in the newspapers. In many countries people put notices in newspapers if they are trying to get a job, hunting for a house or rooms that they can rent, or even when looking for a person who is lost.

When checking to see if the other driver is all right, she finds a trail of blood leading into the forest. Following it, she encounters a deformed serial killer known as Moonface (John DeSantis), dragging the driver of the other vehicle. Narrowly escaping him, Ellen flees into the forest, with Moonface following her trail. Through flashbacks spread throughout, she is shown receiving training from her survivalist husband Bruce (Ethan Embry), training her with both weapons and guerrilla tactics. She attempts to use these skills several times but despite her best efforts is still captured by the killer and taken to his workshop deep in the forest on a ridge overlooking a large waterfall. After awakening in the basement--filled with the corpses of Moonface's previous victims--she encounters the delusional Buddy (Angus Scrimm), apparently insane but seemingly unharmed by Moonface. He speaks cryptically of the killer's methods and intent. Shortly thereafter, the killer comes downstairs, turning on a generator. Police sirens begin sounding as various lights around the room begin flashing. Lifting the other woman onto a large table -- he uses a drill press to remove both of her eyes. After Moonface leaves, Buddy talks Ellen into picking the lock on the chains binding her with a sharp object that had been jabbed into her shoulder. Buddy, who seemed to be tied up, suddenly stands up and begins shouting that Ellen is free. Moonface returns, and Ellen attacks Moonface and Buddy with a piece of wood. She runs upstairs where she is again attacked, but this time manages to overpower Moonface and knock him out a window. Looking out, she sees him dangling by a blanket several meters below, hanging above the waterfall. She watches as the fabric rips, turning away as he finally falls. Finding a gun, belt and boots, she leaves. Returning to her car, she opens her trunk to reveal...\nAnswer:",

I recommend this film highly, for the older Seasoned members whom were living at the time the film was Made. Circa 1959. I must however recommend the remake, If you have not seen the Showtime On the Beach remake, you are missing a lot, The remake brings the futuristic setting, a War between China and The USA. Highly believable, Special effects. It stars Armand Assante, Bryon Brown, And Rachel Ward, of the Thornbirds fame.

It says the deal \"should clear the way for significant progress in our discussions\" with its historic partner, Iran Khodro.\nA partnership with Iran Khodro involves the re-assembly of older Peugeot models made in Europe, but a new arrangement would move to full manufacturing of cars using the most up-to-date methods.\nStock market investors also appear keen. Charlemagne Capital, an asset management group, recently teamed up with a Tehran-based firm to establish a fund to invest in the Iranian securities market.\nThe firm's portfolio adviser, Dominic Bokor-Ingram, said a lot of people had been contacting him in the wake of the announcement: \"You don't often find a closed economy where the stock market is so developed.\"\nIran's stock exchange is cheap and is less than 1% foreign-owned, but liquidity is low and conditions remain economically and politically uncertain.\nIranian-born Xanyar Kamangar, who runs investment and asset management company Griffon Capital, thinks there are huge opportunities in food and drink, pharmaceuticals and technology.\n\"Iran has natural resources that compare with Russia. It has highly educated, very tech-savvy consumers and 92% of its adult population have bank accounts.\"\nBut solicitor Nigel Kushner, director at the British-Iranian Chamber of Commerce, who advises companies on how to legitimately do business in Iran, says there remain real practical stumbling blocks.\nHe warns that until cross-border money transfers are relaxed, it will be very difficult to invest in the country.",

I just hope my 8 month old enjoys just as much as everyone else says their children do. I guess we will find out when Christmas gets here. I do think that the toy (for its size and all that) is a bit pricey. I just hope it is worth it. I bought it because I love the neurosmith products and already have a pretty decent size collection of their products for my children for Christmas also. I know I like the toys (seeing as how I played with them in the store first); I hope that they both will too. The only complaint I have about this toy is that I wish that the cartridges were compatible for this toy as well...so that way there would be a little more variety for the music concepts with this toy. Other than that the toy sounds great!\nAnswer:",

    "question": "Please study this section of the Urantia Papers and tell me about it: \n\n4. Peripheral Paradise\n11:4.1 The central Isle ends abruptly at the periphery, but its size is so enormous that this terminal angle is relatively indiscernible within any circumscribed area. The peripheral surface of Paradise is occupied, in part, by the landing and dispatching fields for various groups of spirit personalities. Since the nonpervaded-space zones nearly impinge upon the periphery, all personality transports destined to Paradise land in these regions. Neither upper nor nether Paradise is approachable by transport supernaphim or other types of space traversers.\n\n11:4.2 The Seven Master Spirits have their personal seats of power and authority on the seven spheres of the Spirit, which circle about Paradise in the space between the shining orbs of the Son and the inner circuit of the Havona worlds, but they maintain force-focal headquarters on the Paradise periphery. Here the slowly circulating presences of the Seven Supreme Power Directors indicate the location of the seven flash stations for certain Paradise energies going forth to the seven superuniverses.\n\n11:4.3 Here on peripheral Paradise are the enormous historic and prophetic exhibit areas assigned to the Creator Sons, dedicated to the local universes of time and space. There are just seven trillion of these historic reservations now set up or in reserve, but these arrangements all together occupy only about four per cent of that portion of the peripheral area thus assigned. We infer that these vast reserves belong to creations sometime to be situated beyond the borders of the present known and inhabited seven superuniverses.\n\n11:4.4 That portion of Paradise which has been designated for the use of the existing universes is occupied only from one to four per cent, while the area assigned to these activities is at least one million times that actually required for such purposes. Paradise is large enough to accommodate the activities of an almost infinite creation.\n\n11:4.5 But a further attempt to visualize to you the glories of Paradise would be futile. You must wait, and ascend while you wait, for truly, \u201cEye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the mind of mortal man, the things which the Universal Father has prepared for those who survive the life in the flesh on the worlds of time and space.\u201d",

I already got the Pro-Mate blades on the T Outliner and Imma bling out this outliner with the Pro-Mate also. Recommend it HIGHLY!!!\nAnswer:",

His mother Patricia also died. Ben's father Harold, 47, - believed by Devon and Cornwall Police to be responsible - died from burns. The 47-year-old, who had mental health issues, had been asked to move out. 'Broken glass' Forensic scientists told the inquest it appeared Mrs Philpotts died in a flash fire after her badly burned body was found near a petrol can. Mrs Philpotts' mother, who lived with the family, said she had heard an explosion and the sound of broken glass but had been unable to reach her daughter because of thick smoke. The scientists said ten-year-old Ben was found with severe head injuries in his bedroom. A sledgehammer was lying nearby. His father was found outside the property with serious burns and died in hospital eight days later. The inquest heard that Mr Philpotts had previously been admitted to hospital for mental health problems which included depression, delusion and paranoia, but he had discharged himself before treatment. It was said that he had been convinced he had HIV and cancer and had Ben tested for HIV. He had also been asked to move out of the family home due to his behaviour. A serious case review, by the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Safeguarding Children Board published in July said that although Mr Philpotts was known to the authorities to have mental health issues, the death of Ben and his mother could not have been foreseen. However, the summary cited \"weaknesses\" in practices within mental health services and communication between agencies, and said Ben's safety at the hands of his father had not been sufficiently considered. The inquest, conducted by Cornwall Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon in Truro, continues.\nA: ",

    "question": "Question: At what age does Neil begin prostituting himself? If there is no answer, please output \"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\". Movie title: Mysterious Skin Context: During the summer of 1981 in Hutchinson, Kansas, eight-year-olds Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, teammates in Little League, both experience life-altering events. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother and already discovering his homosexuality, is sexually abused by his Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, with a neglectful father and a mother who's often working, remembers it starting to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in a crawl space in his house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours. Neil views the coach's abuse as love and becomes mainly attracted to \"bearish\" middle-aged men. He begins prostituting himself at the age of 15. Three years later, he moves to New York City, where his best friend Wendy Peterson now lives, and continues prostituting there. Neil has an emotional encounter with a \"customer\" dying from AIDS. Though Neil suspects the man wants sex, he actually wants nothing more than to feel another person's touch. The encounter leads Neil to start to withdraw from prostitution and take a job as a cashier. For years after coming to in the crawl space, Brian suffers from chronic nosebleeds, blackouts and bedwetting. He has unsettling recurring dreams about being touched by a strange, bluish hand. These odd dreams lead Brian to suspect that he may have been abducted by aliens. Eventually, another boy wearing the same Little League uniform begins to appear with him in these dreams. When he's 18, Brian meets a woman named Avalyn Friesen who also believes she was abducted by aliens.

    "question": "create SEO meta description of this article in less than 160 characters, including spaces:\n\nWay back in IF Insider No. 52, we addressed the issue of the possible negative effects of long-term intermittent fasting. After a careful look at the studies, we came to the conclusion that so far, daily intermittent fasting seems to be quite safe for the majority of people.\n\nOne question that pops up now and then is the question about the effect of IF on bone health, so when we came across this recent review of the literature on this very topic, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, it caught our attention. \n\nIt\u2019s important to understand what a review of the literature means in that the authors did not conduct a research study of their own but looked at multiple studies on bone density and intermittent fasting, which were pulled from the MEDLINE database until the 30th of September 2022. These review studies can be quite helpful in looking at the overall picture of a particular topic of interest, in this case, bone health and intermittent fasting.\n\nThe authors included studies that looked at various kinds of IF protocols, including the 5:2 diet, alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted eating (TRE) on bone health. Many of these animal studies used intermittent fasting and other practices already known to harm bone health, and the authors admit these results would be very difficult to extrapolate to humans. \n\nThe observational studies in humans do suggest some sort of a link between some IF practices, such as skipping breakfast, and a compromise in bone health, but there was no control for what are known as confounding factors, so again, the data are difficult to interpret and to apply broadly. An observational study is one in which the researchers do not make any active experimental intervention.\n\nThe results of the interventional studies that were included do suggest that time-restricted eating protocols up to six months (which both Denise and I practice) do not adversely affect bone health and, in fact, may have some modest protective effect. Studies that looked at ADF showed no negative effects on bone health, and no studies looked at the 5:2 diet and bone health outcomes. \n\nIn addition, the authors point out that these interventional studies are limited by \u201c\u2026short duration, small and diverse population samples, assessment of total body bone mass exclusively (by DXA) and inadequate control of factors that may affect bone outcomes, making the interpretation of existing data challenging.\u201d \n\nNo surprise here that much more research is needed in this area to make a definite call.\n\nIn the meantime, we say fast on! And, do all the things we currently know to protect the health of your bones, meaning adequate Vitamin D, adequate calcium intake from calcium-rich foods as well as Vitamin K2, and strength training along with weight-bearing exercise.",

    "question": "Detailed Instructions: Write the right answer to the question based on the context passage.\nQ: If you've ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you're probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the \"eighth wonder of the world.\"\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there's been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice's major waterway.\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge's construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\nAndrea Palladio's design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte's. Question: what is author opinion?\nA:",

    "question": "In this task, you are given Wikipedia articles on a range of topics as passages and a question from the passage. We ask you to answer the question by classifying the answer as 0 (False) or 1 (True)\n\nLet me give you an example: Passage: Property tax -- Property tax or 'house tax' is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.\nQuestion: is house tax and property tax are same\nThe answer to this example can be: 1\nHere is why: The question asks whether the house tax is the same as property tax. As per the passage, property tax is also called house tax and so the label 1 (True) is correct.\n\nOK. solve this:\nPassage: Carmel-by-the-Sea, California -- Carmel-by-the-Sea, /k\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8m\u025bl/ often simply called Carmel, is a city in Monterey County, California, United States, founded in 1902 and incorporated on October 31, 1916. Situated on the Monterey Peninsula, Carmel is known for its natural scenery and rich artistic history. In 1906, the San Francisco Call devoted a full page to the ``artists, writers and poets at Carmel-by-the-Sea'', and in 1910 it reported that 60 percent of Carmel's houses were built by citizens who were ``devoting their lives to work connected to the aesthetic arts.'' Early City Councils were dominated by artists, and the city has had several mayors who were poets or actors, including Herbert Heron, founder of the Forest Theater, bohemian writer and actor Perry Newberry, and actor-director Clint Eastwood.\nQuestion: is there a difference between carmel and carmel by the sea\nAnswer:",

It said, \"Happiness is a direction, not a destination  .\" I had been having a bad day and just reading this brightened my day a little. I also took out a pen and wrote one of my favorite quotes   down. ww.szzx100.com When I came back to the fence, I saw another quote under mine in the handwriting as the first one. I added another, and we kept at this pattern for quite a while. One day, I was writing another quote on the fence and the old man, one of my neighbors, who owned the fence, saw me. He came out and I was afraid he would be mad at me for writing on his fence; he was not known to be very friendly. He gave me a sharp glance and then read the quotes on the fence. Without saying a word, he said something to himself and then went back inside. I was a bit terrified for a while, afraid to go back to the fence, but when I did, I noticed not more quotes but two words in entirely different handwriting had been added, \"Thank you.\" Later, I saw the old man in his front yard. He beckoned   me over and told me how my quotes had been inspiring him, how he thanked me and how he was glad to see young people still have \"values\". We are now good friend and I talk to him a lot. This experience has changed my life. I still don't know who wrote that very first quote, but if he is out there, I'd like to say \"thanks\" to that unknown friend. Question: We can learn from the passage that   _  . - writing quotes on fences is a good idea - the writer has written three quotes on the fence - the good relationship between neighbors is very important. - the old man has changed his opinion about young people.\nA:",

It's been a solid performer although now I'm having a little difficulty pinning down a source to replace the polyurethane band that just broke from wear and tear. I wouldn't recommend the watch as a primary dive watch, particularly if you're a cold water diver (impossible to work with gloves on). I do wear the watch as an every day watch and for when I'm free diving, snorkeling, open water swimming or any on water activity. I do also attach the watch to my BC as a back up chronometer when I dive (generally 40' - 100'). I haven't had any trouble with water getting into the case. The convex bezel and luminescent hands & hash marks make reading it under water and in low viz pretty easy. I don't use the alarm, so I can't speak to that. There are easier watches to use and read available (digital back lit for instance), but I like the styling and the heft of the watch so I chose it over more utilitarian watches.

Anyone who chooses to read this is better off NOT reading Drama Queen first. It's almost as if the characters were changed. I thought Anjelica was written off at the end of the first story...(On the day they were supposed to wed, Kayla buried her sister--pg 272, Drama Queen). In No More Drama, Anjelica has magically come back to life with a personality 180 and an explanation for all of her transgressions.. I guess anything can happen in a fictional tale, but can we at least add a pinch of reality?Overall, there seemed to be too much going on in so few pages. I actually needed to use Drama Queen as a reference tool to try and make sense out of this mess. I wasn't successful at all.Lajill, you should skip the \"drama\" all together in your next effort.

There was no problem or issue with the vendor and considered them excellent or 5-Star. The product is rated 2-Star. The earlier negative reviews were considered before purchase accurate. The songs and the singing by Neal Diamond (ND) were ok to disappointing only. There was too much commentary between songs and the video was only OK but distracting. The picture was too many times dark and distracting from the music. The sound quality was minimal at best.The songs on the video did not include many of my favorites, especially the song \"America.\" In researching the product, I could not find a listing of the song list prior to purchase, at the time I loved all of ND's songs and still do.I do not replay the video to hear the songs again, apathy, a small disappointment.

Review: I just finished reading this book and it is a huge disappointment for a Crichton novel. It is basically a forum for him to show off how much research he has done on the issue of global warming. When he begins to drone on too long, he suddenly puts in a chapter or so of page-turning action. But it does not work. The characters never grabbed me, the action was completely lacking, and it seemed the characters' actions never really amounted to anything. There were many useless characters, or characters introduced early on that never came back to have their storylines resolved. The climax scene was a cop-out. Crichton should have just written a review article for a trade journal summarizing all the publications he read regarding global warming. Skip this book, it is not worth it. Answer:\nAns:",

Most of the tracks are available on other DJ Tiesto mixes which are cheaper. This album is for those that really know, love and appreciate what Tiesto does in other words don't buy if its your introduction to his work. Start with the magic of the 'In Search of Sunrise' CDs or the 'Magik' series. When you realise his brilliance then consider this purchase to complete your collection but remember it doesn't add anything new.\nAnswer: increase\n\nQuestion: You are considering whether to buy a product.

But at least Sabbath didn't completely rip off any band before them the way Maiden does. The Maiden boys obviously listened to every Uriah Heep and Deep Purple album released in the 70s. (Listen to Uriah Heep's DEMON AND WIZARDS and MAGICIAN'S BIRTHDAY, both of which came out a good 10 years before Maiden made it.) And this live album cannot live up to Deep Purple's MADE IN JAPAN. Do yourself a favor, and skip this for Heep and Purple, both of who did it earlier and better.\nAnswer: decrease\n\nQuestion: You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews.

He does, loses weight, attracts a female dog, and becomes famous.While Ziefert's intentions may be good, i.e. to encourage children to exercise and eat right, the less-than-subtle messages conveyed here are disturbing, to say the least. Is it alright to force someone to exercise, or to threaten them with punishment if they don't? Do we want to perpetuate this society's fascination with and reverence of appearance above all else? How many of us were humiliated by forced exercise or dieting as children, and how do we feel about it now? Did it improve our relationship to food or exercise? Were the results ultimately beneficial?Though this reaction may seem strong, picture books are read and absorbed by impressionable young children, many of whom are already overly body conscious. We don't need to encourage this kind of coercion. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nAnswer: Negative\n\nQuestion: Title: Disappointed.

Although a friend of mine thought it was not very good too. He admitted he might have had a bad day watching it. I thought it was one of the better ones. Sometimes with humor, much of it depends on if you get the humor. The Pinocchio scene where he had to tell Charming some info was hilarious. Charming knows he can't tell a lie and it is clever how they got Pinocchio to answer Charming. The facial expressions of Puss N Boots and the 3 pigs were very fitting.My kids loved it also.

Movie title: Bend It Like Beckham Movie plot: Jesminder \"Jess\" Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) is the 18-year-old daughter of Punjabi Sikhs living in Hounslow, London. Juliette \"Jules\" Paxton (Keira Knightley) is the same age and the daughter of a native English family. Jess is infatuated with football, but because she's a woman, her family won't let her play. However, she sometimes plays in the park with boys including her best friend, Tony (Ameet Chana), a closet homosexual. Whilst on a jog through the park, Jules discovers Jess' skills, befriends her, and invites her to try out for the local women's football team, the Hounslow Harriers coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Jess is extremely happy and excited about the tryouts, even though Joe is skeptical about a new player joining the team. After seeing Jess' skills, Joe accepts her on the team and Jess lies to Joe about her parents being cool with the idea. Jess develops an attraction toward Joe, and when the team plays in Hamburg, Germany and goes out clubbing, they're caught about to kiss by Jules, who also has a crush on Joe, souring Jess and Jules' friendship, as Jules is adamant she'd told Jess about her crush. When Jess goes to Jules' house to try to patch up their friendship, Jules' mother (Juliet Stevenson) is misled and thinks they're hiding a lesbian relationship. Meanwhile, having discovered that Jess has been playing football behind their backs, Jess' parents (Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan) become more strict and forbid Jess from playing any more matches. The elder Bhamras are also distracted by their elaborate wedding plans for Jess' older sister, Pinky (Archie Panjabi). Thanks to Jess and Jules' skills, the Harriers reach the finals of the league tournament. Unfortunately, the final and Pinky's wedding are on the same day. Joe pleads with Mr. Bhamra to allow Jess to play, but Mr. Bhamra refuses, revealing that he doesn't want Jess to suffer the same way he did when he was kicked out of the cricket club because of his being an Indian.

    "question": "Q: In this task you need to indicate the plausibility of reasoning for the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.\nSentence: Pete envies Martin although he is very successful.\n Reason: The 'he' refers to pete because martin although envies. \n Question: Is the above reasoning correct or wrong? \nA:",

Answering these questions, typically involve understanding multiple sentences. Make sure that your answer has the same type as the \"answer type\" mentioned in input. The provided \"answer type\" can be of any of the following types: \"span\", \"date\", \"number\". A \"span\" answer is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. You can directly copy-paste the text from the passage or the question for span type answers. If you find multiple spans, please add them all as a comma separated list. Please restrict each span to five words. A \"number\" type answer can include a digit specifying an actual value. For \"date\" type answers, use DD MM YYYY format e.g. 11 Jan 1992.

Please restrict each span to five words.\n\nPassage: On 2 May, 1687, a Russian army of about 132,000 soldiers, led by knyaz Vasily Golitsyn, left Okhtyrka on the Belgorod Line. On 30 May they were joined by 50,000 Left Bank Cossacks under hetman Ivan Samoilovich at the mouth of the Samora River where the Dnieper turns south. In the heat of summer, 180,000 men, 20,000 wagons and 100,000 horses set out down the east bank of the Dnieper. The huge force, which started too late and was perhaps not well organized,  could only travel about 10km per day. When the Russians reached the Konskiye Vody river on the west-flowing part of the Dnieper, they found that the Tatars has set fire to the steppe . After a few days of marching over burnt land, their horses were exhausted, they were short of water and 130 miles from their goal at Perekop, however Golitsyn built a fortress at Novobogoroditskoe at the junction of the Dnieper and the Samara. On 17 June they decided to turn back. \nQuestion: How many in all were in the Russian army and Left Bank Cossacks that were headed to Perekop in May 1687? \nAnswer type: Number ",

The preferred titles are under forty words and mention the purpose of the bill.\n\n[EX Q]: Technologies for Energy Jobs and Security Act of 2017  This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend and modify tax credits for residential energy efficient property and investments in energy property.  The bill modifies the tax credit for residential energy efficient property to extend through 2021 the credits for expenditures for fuel cell property, small wind energy property, and geothermal heat pump property. For each extended credit, the bill phases out the current credit rate of 30% of expenditures by reducing it to 26% or 22%, depending on the date that the property is placed in service. The bill extends the tax credit for investments in energy property for the following property with construction that begins before January 1, 2022:    fiber-optic solar energy property,  thermal energy property.   fuel cell property,   microturbine property,   combined heat and power system property, and  small wind energy property.  The bill phases out the current credit rate of 30% for investments in geothermal energy property, fiber-optic solar energy property, fuel cell property, and small wind energy property by reducing it to 26% or 22%, depending on the date that the property is placed in service.  The bill also allows an energy tax credit through 2021 for investment in waste heat to power property that does not have a capacity in excess of 50 megawatts. &quot;Waste heat to power property&quot; is property comprising a system which generates electricity through the recovery of a qualified waste heat resource. \n[EX A]: Technologies for Energy Jobs and Security Act of 2017\n\n[EX Q]: Economic Growth and Jobs Act of 1994 - Grants the President authority to declare temporary tax reductions based on economic growth and the rate of national unemployment. \nProvides for a temporary surtax when the economic growth requirements are subsequently satisfied.\n[EX A]: Economic Growth and Jobs Act of 1994\n\n[EX Q]: Diabetes Screening and Medicaid Savings Act of 2007 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require states to provide diabetes screening tests under the Medicaid program for adult enrollees with diabetes risk factors.\n\nProvides a comprehensive package for individuals with diabetes.\n[EX A]:",

Review: My husband and I received the Graco imonitor Digital baby monitor (model # 2795DIG) for my baby shower, just a little over a year ago. I noticed that frequently the base would turn itself off(!) and the dual monitors would beep and flash red, indicating they had lost signal. Of course, most of the time, this would happen in the middle of the night and be a HUGE annoyance waking us with loud beeping. Now the base won't turn on at all, whether plugged in or with batteries, and the limited warranty by Graco is only good for one year with proof of receipt.

The finish is really nice and looks like real, solid oak. I think she would have liked to have more hooks for hanging necklaces but there is plenty of space in the drawers. My only complaint with it is the fact that it can't be put flush against a wall. When it is, the doors containing the hanging jewelry will not open as they extend behind the back of the unit. It needs to sit off the wall by two or three inches. Overall, though, this is a really nice, functional piece.

The plot was too thin, things kept happening too fast to keep in a state of suspense, the bad guys were far too stupid and the hero (Austin) resembled James Bond. I hope Pitt comes back soon. Also I'd rather see Cussler writing his own books himself.I don't recommend this book to dedicated Cussler fans.

In a usually-even-tempered voice, Mr. Schwartau tackles common misconceptions and explains what hackers really are and what threats we should really be worrying about. He has had a reputation of being a Chicken Little with regard to hacking, but at least a respected Chicken Little. None of this is real knock-your-socks-off stuff. But it's good in an enjoyable sort of a way.

Simply put, Red Threads is dull. The writer tells us too much and shows us too little. The protagonist is little more than a bundle of mannerisms, lacking the spark of reality which enlivens Stout's more famous creations, Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.I was disappointed, and I don't recommend this book.

Review: We were expecting that this recording of the Concierto D' Aranjuez came out to be the best, but it shows one more time that only John Williams's recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra bring to the audience the authentic message from the composer. On Manuel's recording is very difficult to hear the guitar and the sound sometime is very weak. Manuel decided to take a lot of notes out on technical challenge parts, maybe he did not know how to practice those parts or he did not have enough time to prepare the piece. I would like to say that Placido Domigo is not a conductor, a good musician can tell the diference between this reocording conducted by Placido and a recording conducted by a real and professional conductor.

    "question": "Part 1. Definition\nIn this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"sympathetic\" and \"stern\") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY.\nPart 2. Example\nContext word: upset.\nAnswer: Sentence 1: PersonX yelled at PersonY because _ was so upset about the news. \nSentence 2: PersonX comforted at PersonY because _ was so upset about the news.\nExplanation: As expected, two sentences contain mentions of PersonX and PersonY and they're quite similar. Their difference is in terms of trigger words (\"yelled\" and \"comforted\"), whcih result in them having different answers. As required by the instructions, the answer to sentence 1 and sentence 2 are PersonX and PersonY, respectively.\nPart 3. Exercise\nContext Word: Golden Retriever.\nAnswer:",

Review: I have recently fallen in love with the Jack Black products, but they got this completely wrong. It's like gel from the 80s, \"lightweight\" my butt. This makes your hair super stiff, and unlike most newer hair products, does not simply brush out. It leaves your hair feeling gritty and with all kinds of white residue. Gross. So upset I spent so much money on this junk, I could've gotten the same type of gel from Walmart for $0.99. Answer:\nAnswer:",

    "question": "Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: How to describe the rising philosophy of the day ? I'd say it is data-ism . We now have the ability to gather huge amounts of data . This ability seems to carry with it certain cultural assumptions--that everything that can be measured should be measured ; that data is a transparent and reliable lens that allows us to filter out emotionalism and ideology ; that data will help us do remarkable things--like foretell the future . At the outset let me celebrate two things data does really well . First , it's really good at exposing when our intuitive view of reality is wrong . For example , nearly every person who runs for political office has an intuitive sense that they can powerfully influence their odds of winning the election if they can just raise and spend more money . But this is largely wrong . After the 2006 election , Sean Trende constructed a graph comparing the incumbent campaign spending advantages with their eventual victory . There was barely any relationship between more spending and a bigger victory . Likewise , many teachers have an intuitive sense that different students have different learning styles : some are verbal and some are visual , some focus on details and some on whole . Teachers imagine they will improve outcomes if they tailor their presentations to each student . But there's no evidence to support this either . Second , data can clarify patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed . For example , I've always assumed people who frequently use words like \" I , \" \" me , \" and \" mine \" are probably more self-centered than people who don't . But as James Pennebaker of the University of Texas notes in his book , The Secret Life of Pronouns , when people are feeling confident , they are focused on the task at hand , not on themselves . High-status , confident people use fewer \" I \" words , not more . In sum , the data revolution is giving us wonderful ways to understand the present and the past . Will it transform our ability to predict and make decisions about the future ? We'll see . Question: Why is the author skeptical of the data revolution ? - Data may not be easily accessible . - Errors may occur with large data samples . - Data cannot always do what we imagine it can . - Some data may turn out to be outdated .\nThe answer is:",

    "question": "Answer the following question: Title: Not Compatible with Sony DCR - TRV480 Review: I ordered two of these batteries and paid for overnight shipping in that I needed them for a rapidly approaching event. When I put them in my Sony DCR-TRV480 camera and tried to charge them, the charge light started blinking after about 30 seconds. The manual stated this indicated the batteries are not compatible with the camera. I tried charging the battery overnight anyways, and the light never stopped blinking. When I tried to power up the camera, I had a message on the LCD saying Sony Info Li Ion Batteries, followed by the camera powering down. When I tried to determine the charge status of the battery, the camera would not provide the requested info. I believe the camera has some intelligence that looks for a chip on the battery to tell it it is a SONY battery. If not, it shuts the camera off. Hence, this battery is not compatible with the Sony DCR-TRV480 camera. Is this product review negative?\n\nOPTIONS:\n1). Yes;\n2). No;\nAnswer:",

The input to this task is a stream of words, possibly from captions generated by a speech-to-text engine, and the output is a grammatically correct version of the input stream. Stream words are in [] and have been separated with a comma. The sentence can contain words that have case, punctuation, stem-based, intra-word, and digit punctuation errors that need to be corrected. For example, the text should be uppercased/lowercased as per necessity (like the beginning of a sentence, proper nouns, etc.), and digits need to be normalized (6 as six and so on). Note that you don't need to normalize the years. You don't need to fully edit the sentences, if end of the input stream contains sentence fragments, keep them as is.\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem?

    "question": "Q: Mr. Roberts can buy a television for $400 cash or $120 down payment and $30 a month for 12 months. How much can he save by paying cash?\nA: Mr. Roberts will make a total payment of $30 x 12 = $360 for 12 months. Thus, the television costs $360 + $120 = $480 when not paid in cash. Therefore, Mr. Roberts can save $480 - $400 = $80 by paying cash. The answer is 80.\nQuestion: The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\nAnswer: To get the perimeter, you add all the sides o the triangles, so the first two sides add up to 40 + 50 = 90 cm. If the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160 - 90 = 70 cm. The answer is 70.\n[Question]Jenny has a tummy ache. Her brother Mike says that it is because Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that he ate. If Mike ate 20 chocolate squares, how many did Jenny eat?\n[Answer]Thrice the number of chocolate squares that Mike ate is 20 squares * 3 = 60 squares. Jenny therefore ate 60 squares + 5 squares = 65 chocolate squares. The answer is 65.\nQ: Tony wants to build the longest rope he possibly can, so he collects all the rope in his home. He finds an 8-foot rope, a 20-foot rope, three 2 foot ropes, and a 7-foot rope. each knot between the ropes makes him lose 1.2 foot per knot. How long is his rope when he's done tying them all together?\nA: The combined length of all the rope is 41 feet because 8 + 20 + (2 x 3) + 7 = 41. He loses 6 feet from the knots because 5 x 1.2 = 6. The final length is 35 feet because 41 - 6 = 35. The answer is 35.\nQuestion: Lao is farming chickens. He can sell each chicken for $1.50. A bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2. Each chicken will need 2 pounds of feed from the time it hatches to the time he sells it. If he makes $65 profit from selling chickens, how many did he sell?\nAnswer: A bag of feed is enough for 10 chickens because 20 / 2 = 10. Each chicken costs $.2 to raise because 2 / 10 = .2. Each chicken results in $1.3 of profit because 1.5 - .2 = 1.3. He sells 50 chickens because 65 / 1.3 = 50. The answer is 50.\nQ: If Ken's house is twice as far from Dawn's house as Mary's house along a certain road, and Ken's house is 4 miles away from Dawn's house along this same road, how much distance (in miles) will Ken cover if he goes from his house to Dawn's house, then Mary's, then back to Dawn's before going back to his own house?\nA:",

    "question": "Please answer the following question: Title: BIG LET-DOWN Review: I purchased this CD based on previous Hed Kandi releases and the other reviews. This release didn't chill me out, it got me angrier and angrier with each unimaginative, annoying, and cheesy track. This is bad pop music at best. Not electronica chillout AT ALL. Every track is exactly the same, with the same uninspiring female vocal in EVERY SONG. And the vocals aren't even soothing, at points as aggravating as a pack of rangy alleycats in heat. And a remake of oran' juice jones's 'I saw you walking in the rain'? Give me a break. So if you are into an ... 2CD collection of a bad carpenters' cover band, this is for you. I would recommend instead Serve Chilled 1 or Cafe del Mar volumen cinco if you are after good chill-out music. Is the review positive or negative?\nA:",

The acting, especially from the main characters, was stiff and wooden, and I didn't buy most of the performances. Even Donald Sutherland comes off badly. And what the heck is up with the costumes? It's bizarre to me that they would go to the trouble of having the Picts speak actual Gaelic and then dress them up like Mohican Indians. With bones in their hair? Are you serious?! The costume designer should be shot for that alone. They may as well have made them orcs! Pass on this unless you are dying for a Roman action flick and have nothing better to do. Answer:\nA:",

First off, when you are watching in game cinematic's there will be horribly long and akward pauses. At first I wasn't sure if I was supposed to press a button or what, but I soon realized that it was just bad editing. Second, when you are in hand-to-hand combat(meele) mode, and want to switch to running to some door somewhere in the level, Neo will walk with his gaurd up at about half the speed. Third, I could swear that all it ever gave me was the \"Y+B\"....\"B\"...\"\\/ Y\" Combo. Fourth, I cannot even begin to critique the camera angles in this game, geesh...Well, I guess if you enjoy fighting giant ants with a torch and hitting the \"Y\" button about ten-thousand times, this is the game for you.PS: I give the W-Brothers a big \"WTF?\" for that last level. Ten whole minutes of ACTION PACKED, dodge, hit.... And you can't even pick where you want to hit the Smith'o bot, it's all just one boring movie... Yawn... Answer:\nThe answer is:",

    "question": "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Sleeping in is one of the best parts of the weekend. After a long, exhausting work week, sometimes all you want to do is sleep. _ Now you can finally catch up on your sleep. Except you can't. When you open your eyes Saturday morning, it's still early. If this were a weekday, you'd be up before your alarm. So what's the deal? We hate to break it to you, but you've pretty much done this to yourself. Your body is very good at recognizing patterns and adjusting accordingly. If you've got a 9-to-5 job, you're getting up early five days a week. This effectively sets your body clock to wake you at a certain time each day. You can shut off your alarm clock, but your body clock will just keep ticking. There's another reason that you probably don't want to think about: You're just not as young as you used to be. We need less sleep as we get older. Babies need between 16 and 20 hours. Teenagers should (but often don't) get nine hours a night. Younger and middle-aged adults need eight. In general, the older you get, the harder it is to snooze the day away. Even if you do manage to sleep in, you may never fully catch up on your sleep. If your body needs eight hours every night and you only get six or seven from Monday to Friday, you'd have to sleep an extra five to ten hours on Saturday to make it up. And experts say even that may not be enough. The bottom line: Sleep when you can, and enjoy those extra weekend morning hours. Who doesn't want a longer weekend? Question: Which of the following is the reason why you can't sleep in on weekends? Options: A: You are not willing to admit that you are old. B: You need to relax on the weekend. C: Your body clock still works on weekends. D: You can never get enough sleep.\nThe answer to this question is:",

The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"sympathetic\" and \"stern\") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY.\n\nEx Input:\nContext Word: productive.\n\nEx Output:\nSentence 1: Being productive at work suited PersonX but not PersonY because _ really liked their job. \nSentence 2: Being productive at work suited PersonX but not PersonY because _ didn't really like their job.\n\n\nEx Input:\nContext Word: deep breathing.\n\nEx Output:\nSentence 1: Deep breathing was practiced by PersonX but not PersonY because _ enjoyed getting centered through meditation. \nSentence 2: Deep breathing was practiced by PersonX but not PersonY because _ hated getting centered through meditation.\n\n\nEx Input:\nContext Word: debris.\n\nEx Output:",

Besides that, it's just plain slow. Throughout an interstellar war the protagonist shifts through so many jobs that the reader can barely keep up. He's an infantry man, no, he's a pilot, no, he's a secret agent, no, he's a false prophet. While the ending did have a few nice surprises I fear most readers will have put the book down long before then, I almost did. Also, Mormon's and a few other religions might be a little offended at the parellels between their church and 'Parafaith's' antagonists. Is the review positive or negative?\nAnswer:",

    "question": "In this task you are given a small conversation between two persons and 4 options on how the conversation should continue. Your job is to choose the most reasonable option. The conversation and the options are separated by a newline character. Each dialogue in the conversation are separated by a comma. F and M indicate female and male, respectively.\nExample: M: Excuse me. How much is this suit? ,F: It's on sale today for $750. It's normally $900. ,M: Wow, that is pretty expensive! I was thinking that it might be 4 or 500. ,F: This material is imported from Italy. It's the finest in the world, and if you bought a suit made of this material at many department stores, you would pay about $2000. ,M: Uh-hah. But isn't that the point of coming to a market like this, to get a discount compared to the expensive department stores? Besides I saw a suit just like this one a few stalls down, and they were selling it for $600. I still thought that it was too expensive. ,F: It's possible that the suit you saw was the same color is this one but made of a different material. Unfortunately, our prices are final, and we think there are the lowest anywhere in the city.\n(A) M: Okay, I'll buy it at the price you want. Here, it's $600. (B) M: Just a minute! I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that? (C) M: Although the material is imported from France, it is not worth the $750 you want. (D) M: You want $900 for the suit? It's too expensive!\nExample solution: B\nExample explanation: Options (A) and (B) are not corrct because the suit's price is 900. Option (C) isn't correct because the material was imported from italy.\n\nProblem: F: More and more people are using reusable grocery bags now. ,M: They're much stronger than plastic bags. And I can fit more in them, too. ,F: Grocery stores like them, too. Because they can make money by selling them. ,M: What's more, you can use them for more than one purpose. I heard that only 3% of plastic bags (?). Imagine all that waste. ,F: And my local grocery store, regular plastic bags aren't free anymore. In addition, they take $0.10 off your bill for every reusable bag you bring yourself. ,M: It's great to see we're taking steps to create a healthier environment.\n(A) F: Sure. With the 10%, I mean $1 discount, people will be encouraged to buy it. (B) F: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand. Could you repeat a little louder, please? (C) F: I think the 10-cent discount is a good sign to encourage us to use reusable bags. (D) F: Even though plastic bags are always free, reusable bags are also 10 cents cheaper.",

    "question": "1. description of the problem and a motivation for why this study:\nSoftware reliability and maintenance have been the core concerns for software developers. A vital role played in software development is undoubtedly by the source code. Though much research is conducted on bugs in source code, our focus is to learn whether the programming languages used by the developers for the source code have a key insight into this. We namely know many popular programming languages adopted by the software developers for their projects. We want to explore and compare projects of different programming languages. We want to find out the projects which are more prone to have bugs by exploring the programming language used to built it. \nA predictor to tell the stakeholders which programming language maybe more suitable for their startup or based on their expertise. (This just an idea if we want to and can extend the work further) \n\n \n\n2. datasets and tools you to use (or create) \nThe dataset we will be using is the World of Code (WoC). And we will be adopting the findings from the Mea Culpa.... paper and the ManySStuBs dataset paper to compare our findings. \n\n \n\n3. concrete research questions labelled RQ1, RQ2, etc. \n\nRQ1: How many types of projects files based on programming languages does the WoC account for? How many programming languages, which is most popular, cluster each programming language based on its type. \n\nRQ2: How many bugs are detected in each specific programming language-based project, how many bugs are fixed, how fast were they fixed, Commit size, etc.... percentages \n\nRQ3: Can the choice of programming language assist software developers in writing codes which are less prone to bugs? \n\nRQ4: Why are the programming languages found more or less prone to bugs \u2026.. (we will know more after finding few things) \n\nRQ5: What types of bugs are there in each programming language based on their impact and cause? \n\n \n\n4. description of proposal, including a schedule of milestones for major tasks \n\nThe final project is expected to be delivered in about four weeks or less. We intend to carry out the project on a weekly basis with weekly synchronization with the team. The expected milestone for each week is as follows: \n\nWeek 7: Basic project research, Discussion with proposal synchronization and finalization \n\nWeek 8: Brushing up our Unix command line skills, Exploring WoC dataset \n\nWeek 9: Complete RQ1, RQ2 \n\nWeek 10: Complete RQ3, RQ4, Start writing final project report \n\nWeek 11: Finalization of final project report, Preparation of project presentation \n\nWeek 12: Submission of final report, Project presentation \n5. list of possible threats to validity and problems, and what you propose to mitigate \n\nFindings may seem obvious. Stakeholders may not necessarily use the programming language that seems more suitable for them for other factors like skillset or libraries prevalent etc \n\ncan you write me a project proposal with the following sections: Motivation, Data, Research Questions, Project Milestone and Threads to Validity",

She turns out to be one of Dr. Evil's fembots, who attempts to kill Austin, then self-destructs. Austin grieves briefly, then proceeds to the hotel lobby nude and celebrates being single again. A NATO monitoring facility observes the return of Dr. Evil, confronting his son Scott, and then starting a riot, on The Jerry Springer Show, and informs British intelligence. At Dr. Evil's Seattle headquarters, Dr. Evil is presented with a one-eighth-size clone of himself whom he calls Mini-Me. Dr. Evil unveils his latest evil plan: he has developed a time machine to go back to the 1960s and steal Austin's mojo, the source of Austin's sexual appeal. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me go back to 1969 and meet a younger Number Two and Frau Farbissina. An obese \"Scottish Guard\" called Fat Bastard extracts Austin's mojo from his frozen body at the Ministry of Defence Cryo Chamber. British intelligence warns Austin that one of Dr. Evil's agents is after him, and during a photo shoot the wanton Ivana Humpalot seduces him, but at the last moment she claims he is too sexy for her to kill him. They have sex in his bed, but do not get far before he discovers that he has lost his mojo and is impotent. The MOD sends Austin back to 1969 with its own time travel device, a convertible Volkswagen New Beetle. Austin arrives at a party in his London pad and with the assistance of a CIA agent, Felicity Shagwell, escapes an assassination attempt by two of Dr. Evil's operatives. Austin and Felicity are pursued by Mustafa, another of Dr. Evil's henchmen; when caught he reveals the existence of Dr. Evil's secret volcano lair. Before he can divulge its location, Mini-Me shoots him in the neck with a dart, causing him to fall off a cliff. After examining photographs from the crime scene at MOD headquarters, Austin identifies Fat Bastard as the perpetrator of the theft of his mojo. At Dr. Evil's lair, Fat Bastard arrives with Austin's mojo. Dr. Evil drinks some of it and...\nAnswer:",

What you will find is the insight of all his tapes on Our Lady synthesized into a single work -- complete with personal anecdotes and the usual healthy dose of excruciating puns.The book is an analysis of Mary in Sacred Scripture, in the doctrine of the Church, and in the plan of God. Yet Dr. Hahn doesn't want us simply to know more *about* Mary -- he wants us to *know* Mary, personally, as the Mother of the Son of God and the Mother of the children of God, Our Mother. If we only know about Mary but don't allow her to lead us to Jesus, our knowledge is in vain. More than anything else, Dr. Hahn's book is a call to prayer, inviting us to get to know (especially through the Rosary) the Mother he has helped us know more about.\nThe answer to this question is:",

They do get a little repetitive in places, since the author can't tell if you have read any others of the series. Hence he has in every book to explain that the Baker rifle is slower to load than a musket, but more accurate; and he always has to belabor the point of the British army having officers of very mixed competence, due to their having bought their commissions instead of earning them. Perhaps the custom prevailed even later, since, in World War I it is said the German General Staff referred to the British soldiers as \"lions, led by donkeys.\" Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nAnswer: Positive\n\nQuestion: Title: OH DESAPOINTMENT!

It also means that there is no inflationary pressure coming from wages.\"\nAustralia's economy has seen growth moderate in recent years after its decade-long boom in the mining sector came to an end.\nThe country's resource companies are in the midst of scaling back operations and cutting production costs to cope with slumping commodity prices.\nEarlier this month, data showed the unemployment rate rose to 6%, the highest level since September 2015.\n\"Business investment is likely to remain negative as the unwind of the mining investment boom continues to weigh,\" Mr Oliver said.\nTo counter the slowdown, the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates to record lows, which has helped boost the housing construction sector.\nWhat was that article about?",

There are so many good songs on it and Dylan's voice is so strong... It's a crime to say he couldn't sing, some people just don't get it. I'm totally pleased and riding along. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nAns: Positive\n\nQues: Title: EVERYTHING MOTHER WOULDN'T SAY AND DAD DIDN'T KNOW Review: I READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS BOOK.AFTER HAVING READ THE BOOK I FEEL THE COUPLE OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO LEAD VERY SHELTERED LIVES OR WON'T EXCEPT THE TRUTH.UNFORTUNATELY FOR MEN THIS BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nAns: Positive\n\nQues: Title: Movie for Schmucks Review: I went into this movie with such high expectations and left thoroughly crushed. I love Carrell and Rudd, I really enjoyed 40 Year Old Virgin and thought the chemistry between the two was terrific. But then there is this UNFUNNY mess. I chuckled and smiled a few times during the movie but overall this movie is simply painful to watch. Zach Galifianakis is absolutely awful and disturbing (and NOT in a funny way), Jemaine Clement as the weirdo artist Kieran is completely unfunny as well (unlike his terrific The Flight of the Conchords). I am sorry I wasted my money buying the blu-ray.Steve Carrell needs to stick with The Office if he is going to continue to make crap like this. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nAns: Negative\n\nQues: Title: Tarkan is MUCH better Review: Wow. Can't say I mind the song all that much, but it just reminds me of another little girl having to show off her body to be popular. But putting that aside, The original by Tarkan is just wayyyyyy better. Sure, it's in Turkish and you may not understand a word of it, but his voice and musical talent will draw you in anyway. Some reviewers have said that Holly Valance is the reason for Tarkan's success with this song, but that is a bunch of bull...Tarkan is successful without the little blonde bombshell.

What was said before this conversation?\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\nW: Are you busy on Tuesday night, Tom?\n\n\ninput question: W: Well, I hope so. You see, I can't find my handbag with my mobile phone and some books in it. I've tried everywhere.  M: Were they the only things in the bag?  W: Well, no. My front door key as well.  M: I'm afraid, madam, we're not having much luck. When did you last have your bag with you?  W: I haven't seen it ever since I went shopping this morning. I went by car and stopped outside the tailor's. I had my mobile phone with me then. I think I put it in my bag but I'm not so sure.  M: Did you ask the tailor?  W: Yes, and I've also been back to the shopping center.  M: So you didn't buy anything at the shopping center?  W: No. Well, I've checked there...oh, dear. I've been awfully silly. I think I've left the bag there.  What was said before this conversation????\noutput answer: M: May I help you, madam?\n\n\nM: Sorry, there is a party going on near the classroom. I suppose I can check the dining room though.  What was said before this conversation?\n----\nAnswer: W: Hey, George, I can't get to sleep with the lights so near my bed. Can you study someplace else?\n\n\nQ: M: Ok. Mom. I'll turn it off.  What was said before this conversation?\nA: W: Turn down the TV a little, Peter. Your father is working at his desk.\n\n\nQuestion: W: Yes, the manager wants to see it before the meeting.  What was said before this conversation?\nAnswer: M: Miss Zhao, do I have to finish the report today?\n\n\nPlease answer this: M: I'm writing to my parents telling them I'll stay here this summer.  W: You're not going home? I thought you were going on a trip to Japan with your family.  M: Well, I intended to go with them, but I thought again and changed my mind.  W: Tell me. I'm interested in knowing what keeps you from joining your beloved family and staying here. It certainly is not studying.  M: No, certainly not. Michael arranged for me to work at his uncle's institution.  W: How much will you be paid?  M: Judy, I don't do it for money, but for experience. Besides, it's voluntary work.  W: You work without payment? That's really something.  M: When will you leave for home?  W: Tomorrow. We'll fly to Hawaii two days after. I really have to pack now.  M: Go then. Have a nice vacation!  W: I'll send you postcards.  What was said before this conversation?\n++++++++\nAnswer:",

As a matter of fact, I read fantasy today because I so enjoyed that series so many years ago. However, I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was trite and the characters did not have the depth that I'm accostomed to seeing in Feist's writing. In addition, some characters from the Rift War Saga seemed like completely new people with no explanation of the change in personality. After starting the Serpent War Saga, I understood that this entire book was only a long, boring prologue to his new long, boring saga. However, I keep reading Feist in the hopes that he will again show the originality and character development that made me love the Rift War Saga. Answer:\n**Answer**",

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story.\nProblem:Premise: My kitchen was filling up with trash. \n Initial Context: I picked up a bag to carry it to my trash can. \n Original Ending: I began to walk down my driveway with the bag. Suddenly, the bag ripped and trash fell everywhere. I cleaned up the spilled trash and put it in the trash can. \n Counterfactual Context: I left the bag for my brother to carry to the trash can.\nSolution:",

The idea that a government dominated by state-rights advocates is weak is certainly not new. Eicher sets out to show the weakness of the Confederate central government through a series of vignettes describing the relation between Davis and some other person in the government. The two main problems with this approach are: (1) Eicher assumes I know lots of things about the obscure people in the Confederate government already (which I don't); and (2) there seems to be no central thesis that is supported.I expect that a well written biography of Davis would cover most of this material in a much more comprehensive manner.

I'd read Teen Witch and absolutely loved it (though I know think it's pathetic), so naturally I bought this book soon after. Even then I was disappointed.First of all, I dislike the way RavenWolf puts down the word Wicca. Very early on in the book, she says she uses the word Witchcraft because Wicca reminds her of that old movie The Wicker Man and furniture. ...Second, this book is so full of fluffy bunny [stuff] I want to vomit. It's really hard to put my finger on what it is about this book I dislike so much, it just doesn't strike me as accurate information about Wicca, it just seems like some New Age form of Witchcraft churned out to make some money.

If 2 / 3 represents Grant's age in five years, then the fraction representing the number of years the hospital is older than Grant is 1 - 2 / 3 = 1 / 3. If 2 / 3 represents 30 years, 3 / 3, which is the fraction representing the age of the hospital, represents 3 / 3 * 30 * 3 / 2 = 45 years. Currently, the hospital is 45 - 5 = 40 years old.\n[Q & A] The question is In five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital that he is hired into. If Grant is currently 25 years old, how old is the hospital now?\nThe answer is 40\n\nStep-by-step reasoning process: Sidney does 20 on Monday + 36 on Tuesday + 40 on Wednesday + 50 on Thursday = 146 jumping jacks. Brooke does 3 x 146 = 438 jumping jacks.\n[Q & A] The question is Sidney does 20 jumping jacks on Monday, 36 on Tuesday, 40 on Wednesday, and 50 on Thursday. Brooke does three times as many jumping jacks as Sidney. How many jumping jacks did Brooke do?\nThe answer is 438\n\nStep-by-step reasoning process: Let B be the cost of the blue socks. 4 * 3 + 6 * Y = 42. 12 + 6 * Y = 42. 6 * Y = 30.

If the red socks cost $3 each, how much did he pay for each blue pair?\nThe answer is 5\n\nStep-by-step reasoning process: His bedroom is 309 sq ft and his bathroom is 150 sq ft so these two rooms are 309 + 150 = 459 sq ft. He wants the new room to be twice as large as his bedroom / bathroom that is 459 sq so the new room is 2 * 459 = 918 sq ft.\n[Q & A]",

Possible types are explained below.\nPolicy: This refers to a sentence proposing a specific course of action to be taken. It typically contains modal verbs like \"should\" and \"ought to\". It cannot be directly proved with objective evidence, and a proper type of support is a logical reason from which the proposition can be inferred.\nValue: This refers to a sentence containing value judgments without making specific claims about what should be done (If so, then it is a Policy sentence.). Because of the subjectivity of value judgments, it cannot be proved directly with objective evidence.\nFact: This refers to an objective proposition expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. A Fact sentence has a truth value that can be verified with objective evidence that may be available at the time the claim is made; predictions about future are considered unverifiable.\nTestimony: This refers to an objective sentence about the author's personal state or experience. Evidence for Testimony is not publicly available in most cases.\nInput: topic: My opponent will lose this debate if he or she does not follow these rules.\nsentence: In his 2nd rule above, he uses the term \"whaling\", which, having checked the dictionary, is verifiably a noun.",

Article: Kate Anderson became an accidental car thief when she went to pick up her daughter's car near an Ohio University building last week.Anderson saw the nickelgray Toyota Camry and used her daughter's key to unlock the car,start the engine and drive home. When Charlie Vansant left class a short time later,he found only an empty parking spot.He first assumed the car had been towed,but when the police couldn't find a record of it,they took a theft report. The morning after Anderson took back the car,her daughter discovered the Camry in the driveway wasn't hers.She found Vansant's name on paperwork in the glove compartment and looked up his phone number on the Website for the university. When she told Vansant the car was in her driveway,\"It sounded real fishy at first,like maybe she wanted to hold the thing for ransom,\"Vansant said! He eventually went to the house with a police officer,where he was reunited with his car.According to a police report,the case was closed \"because of the mistaken car identity.\"Anderson wasn't charged. Vansant seemed to blame the car company more than the \"thief\".\"Her key fit not only my lock,but my ignition as well--so highfive for Toyota,I guess,\"he said. Toyota spokesman Bill Kwong said  key technology wasn't as sophisticated as two decades ago,and there were so many ways to cut a key,making it possible for such a mixup to occur.He said the company now has a microchip embedded in the keys for 90 percent of its vehicles that allows them to start only with the correct key. Question: According to the passage,it can be learned that  _ - the daughter is more honest than her mother - many thefts occurred because the same keys were used - Toyota Camry is a kind of car,which is easier to unlock - the car producers should pay more attention to car identity\nThe answer is:",

Along with Windham, Travis joined fellow '90s motocross phenom Robbie Reynard, along with whip-connoisseur Brett Cue for an epic weekend of racing, nac-nacs, backflips, and of course, some fifth gear-pinned pond skimming.

After he escapes he calls on someone whose life he had saved, Cammillus, -he knew he could count on him. Together Cammillus and Hylas under go their own investigation to figure out the true culprit is.

The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI. Jaime Weston, the league's vice president of brand and creative, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter \"L\" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.\nA:",

In school, have you ever seen a left handed desk ? They don't exist . Many left handed items cost more . The computer mouse is designed for right handers . Scissors for right handers . Only a lefty would understand this . But do you know that right handed people operate in the left side of the brain . Left handed people use the right side . Therefore, only left handed people are in their right mind . Left Handers certainly earned the right to have a day special for them . This special day was first declared and celebrated on Friday , August 13, 1979 by an organization called Lefthanders International . They chose to open their business on that day to address the myths and misconceptions about left-handers . They published a magazine for left-handers and they sold left-handed products for more than twenty years before going out of business a few years ago. The holiday is celebrated annually on the 13th of August . But Left-handers Day is not merely a celebration of the creative superiority of lefties , it also aims at raising awareness of the difficulties presented by a right-handed world . This is a day for left-handers to show their pride and pay tribute to famous left-handers past and present , including some of our greatest artists , athletes and entertainers . Furthermore , this day is to praise the creativity and talents of those left-handers who are less famous but equally productive members of our society . So take a minute to appreciate your left handed friends and loved ones . Don't forget to send them a Left Handed Day E-card to show your respect . Remember that \"Leftis have rights!\" \n Answer: Because left-handers aren't paid enough attention to .\nA: ",

    "question": "Draft a tweet about the latest research paper\n\nAbstract: Fine-tuning continuous prompts for target tasks has recently emerged as a compact alternative to full model fine-tuning. Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

It evokes profoundly elemental visual imagery and allows the listener to access ancient primeval, chthonic memory sources. Answer:\nA:",

Question: WHO IS THE OWNER OF ROSE THEATRE? Movie title: Shakespeare in Love Movie plot: The film centres around the forbidden love of William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) and a noble woman, Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow).As the film begins, Shakepeare's patron Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) finds himself in debt to loan shark Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson). Henslowe offers Fennyman a partnership in the upcoming production of Shakespeare's newest comedy, Romeo and Ethel, The Pirate's Daughter promising that it will be a hit. This play will later be renamed Romeo and Juliet and be reworked into a tragedy (but with some comical undertones with a few characters, like the Nurse).Will Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block and has not completed the play, but begins auditions for Romeo. A boy named Thomas Kent is cast in the role after impressing Shakespeare with his performance and his love of Shakespeare's previous work. Unbeknownst to Shakespeare and the rest of the theater company, Kent is young noblewoman Viola de Lesseps. Viola de Lesseps's dream is to act, but as women were barred from the stage, she must disguise herself as a young man in order to fulfill her dream.After Shakespeare discovers his star's true identity, he and Viola begin a passionate secret affair. There are strong parallels between the pair's romance and the romance in Romeo and Juliet, including the ballroom scene from act 2 and the balcony scene immediately following it. The element of forbidden love forms the basis of Shakespeare's inspiration, and many of their conversations later show up as some of the most famous quotes in the play.Inspired by Viola, Shakespeare begins writing feverishly. His work in progress also benefits from the off-hand advice of playwright and friendly rival Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett). Yet Shakespeare and de Lesseps know that their romance is doomed. Shakespeare is married, albeit long separated from his wife, and Viola is a noblewoman whose parents would never permit her to marry a commoner such as Shakespeare. In fact, Viola's father has privately arranged a betrothal for her to...\nA:",

Question: Who does Lola try to save? Movie title: Run Lola Run Movie plot: The movie opens with a series of questions about humanity and what we know to be true. After the credits, the camera zooms into a house and stops at a ringing telephone. Lola picks up and begins talking to Manni. Manni is in a telephone booth and questions her about where she has been since she was supposed to be waiting for him at the spot they had planned on. She tells him some guy stole the moped she was on while she was in the store and that it happened so fast she couldn't catch up to him. Manni begins to cry. He tells Lola that he made a big mistake and claims they're going to kill him. Lola asks him what happened and he begins to recollect the events. He says everything was going as planned; the car transactions went well, he got the diamonds he needed and crossed the border successfully, his encounter with a dealer went well, and he got the money he needed: 100,000 marks. All that was missing was her waiting for him at the spot. He walked to the train station and got on, but a bum bumped into him and fell. He helped the bum up, but two security guards got on the train. On instinct, he got off leaving the bag of money on the seat. He did not realize it until a minute or two later. He tried to go back to get the money but was stopped by the two security guards. The train left with the bag of money and the bum opened it, immediately grabbing it for himself. Manni tells Lola he would not be in this situation if she had been there on time. He blames her for being so sensitive and for believing love can solve anything. He tells her to come up with 100,000 marks in twenty minutes because that is all the time he has left before he has to meet Ronnie, his boss, and turn in the money or else he will kill him. He begins to tell her that over and over again until Lola screams \"Stop\" so loud, a few glasses on her TV set break. She finally tells him that she will come up with something in twenty minutes. She tells him to stay where he is and she will get him the money. He gets desperate and spots a store across...\nAnswer:",

Grandpa is making his famous pancakes and as he is flipping them over one flies into the air andlands on one of the kids. That night Grandpa told the kids the best bedtime story ever!Grandpa's story takes place in the town of Chewandswallow. It's like any other town except that it gets its weather 3 times a day at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.The townspeople carry around their knives, forks, and plates. That's because it never rains rain or snows snow - it rains orange juice and snows mashed potatoes!Then one day the weather takes a turn for the worse and the people of Chewandswallow are not safe anymore!This story is absolutely delightful but the illustrations just bring this book to life. Ron Barrett illustrates the book and his work is so detailed and eye-catching.I love the tomato tornado and the jello mold sunset pictures. Just everything about this book is imaginative, creative, and unique.\nAnswer:",

Harrington promises to cancel an investigation of Karswell's involvement in Satanism if Karswell will rescind a threat he has made against Harrington. After learning that a parchment given to Harrington has disintegrated, Karswell glances at the clock and ushers Harrington out, promising to do all that he can. As Harrington drives home, a gigantic demon materialises and pursues him. Losing control of the car, Harrington crashes into an electrical pole and is electrocuted. Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in England to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. Holden is informed of Harrington's death and that the only link between it and Karswell's cult is an accused murderer, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition. Following Harrington's notes, Holden visits the British Museum's library to examine books on witchcraft. A book Holden requests is discovered to be missing. Karswell offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington's funeral, Holden meets the dead man's niece, Joanna (Peggy Cummins), who gives him Harrington's diary. It reveals Harrington's increasing fear of Karswell's power. Holden remains sceptical, but goes with Joanna to Karswell's mansion the next day. There, Holden and Karswell mock each another's beliefs. A very strong windstorm abruptly starts, which Karswell claims to have created with a spell. When Holden continues to mock him, Karswell grows angry and predicts that Holden will die in three days. Holden and his colleagues discuss Karswell and make plans to further examine Rand Hobart. Harrington's diary mentions the parchment passed to him by Karswell; Holden finds a parchment with runic inscriptions that Karswell secretly passed to him at the library. Powerful winds come...\nA:",

    "question": "rephrase the following text to improve prose: Witnessing these realities, I began to think about how we could deploy efficiently and precisely our resources in the face of a sudden public health crisis. Back then, I already began to learn some of the techniques of machine learning and help a healthcare company develop a customer service bot through my research. And I started to think more deeply about whether these data science tools could be applied to the management and deployment of healthcare resources. Bearing these questions in mind, I started looking through the previous literature which took me into an area that excited me. I got to know that the concept of operations research had been explored extensively in healthcare management. For example, the development of operational tools has helped to prioritize and triage patients in emergency departments, or through telemedical physician triage to provide timely guidance and treatment, as well as to avoid cross-contamination and standing in a long queue when going to hospital. As I read and studied these articles, I decided to choose a more meaningful career path, letting my love for data science and medicine guide me to realize the innovation of operations research in healthcare system management and to contribute to the optimization of future healthcare resource deployment. As we all know, only with advanced applications of operations research can we help the marginalized people to enjoy the resources and assistance that are rightfully theirs, so that they could lead a live of high quality as others. Therefore, I will strive to achieve this goal throughout all my life.",

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.\nInput: This paper presents a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) type using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). Many standard GNN variants propagate information along the edges of a graph by computing ``messages'' based only on the representation of the source of each edge. In GNN-FiLM, the representation of the target node of an edge is additionally used to compute a transformation that can be applied to all incoming messages, allowing feature-wise modulation of the passed information.\n\n Results of experiments comparing different GNN architectures on three tasks from the literature are presented, based on re-implementations of baseline methods. Hyperparameters for all methods were found using extensive search, yielding somewhat surprising results: differences between baseline models are smaller than reported in the literature. Nonetheless, GNN-FiLM outperforms baseline methods on a regression task on molecular graphs and performs competitively on other tasks.",

An anaphor is an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression. Anaphor number agreement is a restriction where a phrase agrees with the preceeding expression: plurals match plurals or singular expressions match singular expressions. In this task a valid representation of anaphor number agreement should be denoted as 'good' while everything else should be denoted as 'bad'. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match.\nExample: Bob helped himself to some food.\nExample solution: good\nExample explanation: The use of himself agrees with the singular subject Bob.\n\nProblem: Customers don't respect himself.",

There was a vast void of darkness which I could not fill. For the time, I deemed the darkness atheism, and I accepted it. But, can one believe in atheism ? An oxymoron is not worth the true fidelity of trust. Fate brought the Tao to me; I was destined to read it. Can one describe birth, love, or an epiphany ? Without the Tao, nothing matters and with it nothing matters. It is the perception of the paradox that drives us.

Some of them are just faces of people who interest me.  W: Do you let them know that you're taking pictures of them?  M: I try not to.

    "question": "Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Original assured fantastic! Product review: This album is my favorite Beefheart cut. This is him at his most assured. The production is perfect and the band is right there making this difficult music easy. With Trout Mask Beefheart had to mutate his blues musicians to get what he wanted. These guys grew up on Trout Mask and there is an easy joy in their playing. The use of mellotron is startling. Beefheart is very painterly with his music and once you get past the initial shock of his supreme originality you find an invigorating life affirming beauty. The sleeve art by the Captain will give some indication of what is inside, if you see something in it then try the album. Favorite tracks: \"Sheriff of Hong Kong\", \"Sue Egypt\" and \"Brickbats\". Has to be one of the greatest recording artists of the century.\nAnswer:",

Many people that have read this book may think that this is the true story of his life, that he wasn't the hero that we should have. What many people don't know is that Mr. Bleeker had written this book to get back at Bruce for marrrieing Linda Lee Cadwell. If im not mistaken an attpemt to hinder the publishing of this book was made. This book also reminds me of one of those phycic hotlines that claims that they will bring you closer to your dead loved ones. People do alittle more research on Bruce Lee before you read this book.

    "question": "Question: Title: Prior Review: Although only eight years old, 'ISDN' appears to be from a completely different era - one in which fractals were extremely cool, ISDN itself was strange and exotic, and extended sample-heavy dub jams with gated reverb were the cutting-edge of 'intelligent techno music'. This is essentially a less-slick variation on 'LifeForms', in that it combines overproduced mid-tempo breakbeats with a surface sheen of 'high art', one which is demolished by the smug inlay notes. It's as if the group were ashamed to be producing dance music, but weren't smart enough to do anything else. 'Accelerator', for example, was more vital and alive, whilst this and 'LifeForms' seem to be the sound of two people showing off their in-depth knowledge of an Akai S1100. There is a happy ending, of sorts - their last album, 'Dead Cities', was fantastic. Is the review positive or negative?\nAnswer:",

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story.\n\nExample input: Premise: Susie was sitting on her barstool. \n Initial Context: She kept kicking the counter with her feet. \n Original Ending: Suddenly, her kick sent her falling backwards.

My husband originally purchased these to store homemade baby food so that we could freeze them into individual sizes. I would make a good amount of baby food, freeze them in here then transfer it to food saver bags or ziplock. Then when feeding time came, I would pull a fruit cube, veggie cube, and meat cube. This allowed for a great variety in their diet. When my children outgrew baby food, we used these for not only ice, but freezing pesto cubes and broth to add to soups or pasta sauces.
