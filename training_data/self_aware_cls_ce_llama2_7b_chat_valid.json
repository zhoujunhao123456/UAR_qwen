Players take turns taking a card from either the stock or discard pile and discard one from their hand. The object is to end the game, or ‘knock’, when one of the two players has completed their hand of cards. This is done by arranging their cards into ‘sets’ or ‘melds’ of three or more cards of either the same value or a same suited straight. A player can knock if the total value of the cards not used in sets is equal to ten or less. Upon knocking, points are awarded for the difference in value between the unused cards held by the players. If a player manages to get 0 points when knocking, or holds a lower value than the opponent when the opponent knocks, extra points are awarded.",
